  <h2>Writing</h2>

        <p>Later in life, I hope to devote myself to the betterment of writing, this is to say I wish to be an editor. But one cannot just edit otherâ€™s papers, one needs to know what it feels like to write such papers. As such, I have supplied examples of my writing ability. I mostly write fantasy and science fiction. The weirder the subject matter, the happier I am. I can write about 2000 words in an hour, if I am really pushing myself. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid_4">  
  <h2>Design</h2>
  
        <p>Many of the projects I have designed for originate from the classes I am taking at Eastern Washington University. However, most of the flyers were requested by my places of work or from the clubs I was a part of. </p>
  </div>
<div class="grid_4">
    <h2>Editing</h2>
  
        <p>My dream job is to be an editor. As such, I need as much experience as possible. My prices vary depending on length and if a critique is needed, if it is just straight editing it follows the prices below, for critiques add $10. Follow the submission process </p>
